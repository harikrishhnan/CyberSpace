# CyberSpace
A simple web page which act as a dictionary for cybersecurity , based on the OSINT Frameworks.

Our idea for this real-time problem is to create awareness to the people which would be delivered at their finger tip. Our idea is to create an web page which supports cross platform and implies Cyber security to the users. The main motive of this project is to bring everything related to cyber security at a single place. The webpage will have all the features regarding cyber threats, news, related laws, links to authorized websites where awareness about cyber threats are posted, Indian government cyber security awareness portals. Features like helping the user to select the apt antivirus software solution for their electronic device, creating a roadmap for those who are interested to pursue career in cyber security field but donâ€™t know how to start and where to start will be provided. By this we provide everything related to cyber security at a single point through our webpage.
